This project is a simple framework for an adventure game. In this version,
it has a few rooms and the ability for a player to walk between these rooms.
That's all.

To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method.

This project was written to illustrate the use of enums to support
language independence of the game logic.

Read chapter 7 of the book to get a detailed description of the project.
